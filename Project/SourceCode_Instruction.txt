My Project:
Take the sales Kaggle sales data and follow the first link above until ready
for modeling. Then, follow the second and third links to fit the model.

Explanation in presentation: "I wanted to brush up on my R and time series 
after spending some time learning Python so I attempted to replicate a Python
analysis in R on a practice set performed by [name, link] and decided to 
take it a step further... Furthermore, I wanted to experiment with different
plot themes and automating ts analysis processes."

Project plans:
•	Time series analysis:
o	Includes forecasting with a few different models
o	Includes descriptive/exploratory charts
•	Interactive (htmlwidget) libraries of interest:
o	Dygraphs
o	Highcharter
